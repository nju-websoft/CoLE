# I Know What You Do not Konw: Knowledge Graph Embedding via Co-distillation Learning

> Knowledge graph (KG) embedding seeks to learn vector representations for entities and relations. Conventional models reason over graph structures, but they suffer from the issues of graph incompleteness and long-tail entities. Recent studies have used pre-trained language models to learn embeddings based on the textual information of entities and relations, but they cannot take advantage of graph structures. In the paper, we show empirically that these two kinds of features are complementary for KG embedding. To this end, we propose CoLE, a **Co**-distillation **L**earning method for KG **E**mbedding that exploits the complementarity of graph structures and text information. Its graph embedding model employs Transformer to reconstruct the representation of an entity from its neighborhood subgraph. Its text embedding model uses a pretrained language model to generate entity representations from the soft prompts of their names, descriptions, and relational neighbors. To let the two model promote each other, we propose co-distillation learning that allows them to distill selective knowledge from each otherâ€™s prediction logits. In our co-distillation learning, each model serves as both a teacher and a student. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the two models outperform their related baselines, and the ensemble method CoLE with co-distillation learning advances the state-of-the-art of KG embedding.

## Dependencies

- pytorch==1.10.2
- transformers==4.11.3
- contiguous-params==1.0.0


## Running
For a given dataset, the first step is to fine-tune a [BERT](https://huggingface.co/bert-base-cased/tree/main) model based on the descriptions of entities, which will be loaded as a basic module before training N-BERT. Then train N-BERT and N-Former, respectively, and the both trained models are used for co-distillation learning.
